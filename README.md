## Introduction

Concealed object segmentation is a challenging computer vision task that involves identifying objects that are partially or fully hidden from view. The goal of this repository is to advance the state-of-the-art in concealed object segmentation by providing a comprehensive evaluation toolbox and benchmarking results for various deep learning models.

## Dataset Description

The concealed defect segmentation dataset (CDS2K) contains 2000 high-resolution images of industrial parts with various types of concealed defects. The dataset is divided into two sets: training (1600 images) and test (400 images) sets. Each image in the dataset is annotated with pixel-level segmentation masks for the concealed defects.

## Evaluation Toolbox

We provide an evaluation toolbox that includes code for computing various metrics such as pixel accuracy, mean intersection over union (mIoU), and F1 score for evaluating the performance of deep learning models on the CDS2K dataset.

## Benchmarking Results

We benchmark the performance of several state-of-the-art deep learning models on the CDS2K dataset and provide the results in this repository.

## Survey Papers

We include survey papers that provide an overview of the latest research in concealed object segmentation using deep learning techniques.
